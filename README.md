Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) in Java: Console-Based Application

This project is a console-based Java application that demonstrates the principles of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) in action. It is designed to showcase the core concepts of OOP—encapsulation, inheritance, polymorphism, and abstraction—through practical implementation. The project operates entirely within a command-line interface, making it lightweight and accessible while focusing on functionality and design patterns.
Key Features:

    Class and Object Design:
    The application features well-structured classes and objects that represent real-world entities, emphasizing reusability and modular design.

    Encapsulation and Data Management:
    Data is securely managed using getter and setter methods, ensuring proper encapsulation and data hiding.

    Inheritance and Polymorphism:
    The project demonstrates inheritance to share common attributes and behaviors among classes and polymorphism to achieve dynamic method dispatch.

    Abstraction:
    Abstract classes and interfaces are utilized to define high-level behavior and enforce implementation consistency across subclasses.

    File Handling (Optional):
    Data can be persisted using file handling, enabling basic CRUD operations for storing and retrieving information.

This project is a perfect fit for anyone learning Java or seeking to build a foundational understanding of OOP principles. It provides a solid starting point for transitioning into GUI-based applications or more advanced Java frameworks.
